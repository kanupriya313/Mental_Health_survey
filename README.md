# Mental_Health_Survey
The survey was conducted on different employees from companies worldwide, to know about their opinions on mental health. The main countries from which the survey was collected were USA, UK, Canada, Russia and many more. In total there were 48 countries and total of 1259 participants in the survey from different technological companies. USA contributed the most with 748 participants, while UK stood second with 184 participants.

Considering all the countries, 289 employees thought that discussing mental health issues with their employees would results into negative consequences. Among these 289 employees, 66 were females, 213 were males and 10 were others. However, 489 employees have oppositive thoughts about discussing the mental health issues, while 476 employees (37%) are not sure on any opinion. However, in case of physical health issues, 922 (a majority of employees) thought that discussing physical health issues with employers do not result into negative consequences, And only 4% employees thought of having negative consequences. But surprisingly, here the number of people who were unsure about their opinion was only 273 (21%). So, there were possibilities of employees having different opinion for mental health concern but due to some hesitation they choose to answer, “may be” instead of “yes” or “no”. 

In small companies, majority of employees responded that their employers did not provide resources to seek help in case of mental health issues. However, in medium sized companies, majority employees were unsure about this fact. This might be due to lack of awareness about their company’s policies and benefits. However, in big companies with more than 1000 employees, 43% of employees were satisfies and agree with the fact that their employers provided them the required resources to seek help.

Moreover, company with any size, have an approximate equivalent proportion of people sought treatment for mental health. So, there may be a case of unawareness about mental health and their policies and benefits provided by companies to help with mental health issues.
